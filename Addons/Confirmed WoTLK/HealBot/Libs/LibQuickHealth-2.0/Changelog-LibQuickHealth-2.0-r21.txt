The long-no-update version is usable in WLK. But when players are alive immediately, for instance, releasing soul in NAXX will make one be alive in graveyard, there is no event trigger. The players remains zero-hp (actually their HP is full) for a long time.

This patch fixes the bug, not offcially though :)
