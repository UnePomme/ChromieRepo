I just installed Bartender4, but my keybindings do not show up on the buttons/do not work entirely.
|r
Bartender4 only converts the bindings of Bar1 to be directly usable, all other Bars will have to be re-bound to the Bartender4 keys. A direct indicator if your key-bindings are setup correctly is the hotkey display on the buttons. If the key-bindings shows correctly on your button, everything should work fine as well.

|cffffd200
How do I change the Bartender4 Keybindings then?
|r
You can either click the KeyBound button in the options, or use the |cffffff78/kb|r chat command to open the keyBound control. 

Once open, simply hover the button you want to bind, and press the key you want to be bound to that button. The keyBound tooltip and on-screen status will inform you about already existing bindings to that button, and the success of your binding attempt.

My BagBar does not have the Keyring on it, how do i get it back?
|r
Its simple! Just check the Keyring option in the BagBars configuration menu, and it'll appear next to your bags.

|cffffd200
I've found a bug! Where do I report it?
|r
