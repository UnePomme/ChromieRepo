Changelog

v1.02
- Added a new feature that will display a chat notification when the user recieves game data from another user with the original version of Peggle (1.0). This notification will let you know that they are using a very outdated version, and to let them know so they can update, otherwise they can't play with Peggle users with later versions.
- Added a new option to the options screen, called "Hide Outdated Chat Notifications" which will hide the Peggle 1.0 user notifications.
- Added new code that will prevent communication from users with outdated Peggle addons. In order to Duel or Battle other players, they will need the same version of Peggle.
- Added a new Brag window, allowing the user to select what channel to brag the results to (Guild, Party, Raid, or a player-made channel that the user is currently a member of)
- Changed the "Publish" button to called "Brag" in order to bring the button in line with what it actually does.
- Removed "Default Publish Channel" from the option screen. This feature is now built into the brag screen.
