===============================================
I often miss guild and party messages popping up on my screen since they don't make a sound. I figured I'd make a mod to solve the problem. :)

Features:
-Can play new sounds for Guild, Officer, Party, Raid Messages and Whispers.
-Force Whisper sounds for every whisper.
-Allows users to /r after sending a whisper without getting a reply.
-Has a Configuration Dialog Box which is accessable through the comic bubble icon next to the Chat Frame.
-Saves its settings per character.
