Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Add new files to Babelfish.lua
	- Poke for locale update.
	- Cleanup up and re-indented BlizzardArt sources.
	- Added a Bartender-specific toggle-actionbar-lock keybinding.
	- Disabeld "ActionBar Paging" by default.
	- Don't modify the hotkey position when LBF is loaded, as a skin could modify this.
	- Improved sliders in the options with softMin/softMax and bigStep to offer more freedom in configuration.
	- Remove old unused option code snippet
Thomas Schaap:
	- Added a Defaults option tab which can be used to reset a profile to a close approximation of Blizzard's UI.
	Note that to get even closer a couple of other things would need to be changed, such as strata options and the bag bar's layout.
	- Corrected a small error in the default values for BlizzardArt.
	- Added BlizzardArt module to existing code.
