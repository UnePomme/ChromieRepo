Factionizer - A faction reputation management tool
--------------------------------------------------

History
-------
On August 10 2007 john.ra reported in alt.games.warcraft the URL of
the following reputation calculator.

	http://reputation.mygamesonline.org/

I thought it was awseome. Unfortunately it went offline for quite some time
due to over-traffic and during that time I had the idea that it would be
very neat to have something like this, especially considering that the
information to calculate everything was more or less available from the
WoWWiki faction pages.

Urbin, Dun-Morogh (EU)


Features
--------
This addon displays how many reputation points are missing to the next
reputation level in your reputation window. In addition, it extends the
reputation detail window by showing how many points you need for your
next reputation level and how you can best gain this reputation.


Thanks
------
To Shanti, Luidor/Dougi and Milamber of <Hüter des weißen Feuers>,
Syrenia of <Orden des Blutraben> and Tattoo of <Dark Desire> of
EU-Dun Morogh for their help on localising the faction names.


Sources
-------
All information regarding the reputation gained for each faction comes
from http://www.wowwiki.com/Faction. German localisation of quests, mobs
and items come from http://www.buffed.de/
